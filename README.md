The following VBA code generates a Word and PDF form given an excel spreadsheet with multiple and unique entries. There is an option to send this form by email to any recipient.

By clicking on "Generar Reportes" the code loops each entry opening the template file and filling it with its corresponding tag info
There is no entries (rows) nor tags (columns) limit. However, notice there should always be one empty column between tags and "Last Generation" column.
Columns A and B (PDF and Email) should always have either "SI" or "NO". Likewise, these two first columns shouldn't be deleted.
